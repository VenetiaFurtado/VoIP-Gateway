The project evaluated the Broadcom BCM2837 microcontroller for use in a VoIP Gateway Design Evaluation, assessing its performance. The evaluation included testing the processor’s capability of running both Windows 10 IoT and Linux operating systems.

A direct requirement for the project was evaluating of the system’s ability to handle G.711 encoding and decoding. This functionality was successfully implemented using GCC on Raspbian Linux, and test files confirmed the outputs were accurate. Additionally, a diagnostic script was developed to display critical system information, such as running processes, kernel version, and kernel dumps. The script was configured to run on boot, demonstrating its applicability to real-world use cases. Further development included building a PBXsystem with Asterisk, where SIP phones and a laptop were configured to simulate VoIP communication. Tests included voicemail functionality and a phone-to-phone call, successfully demonstrating the system’s capabilities. A Python-based web server was also implemented, providing a home webpage that displayed the current time and access count for the Raspberry Pi Model 3B.

The evaluation confirmed that the Broadcom BCM2837 processor is suitable for the project’s requirements, offering adequate performance. However, it is not readily available on the market today. As an alternative, the Texas Instruments AM625 series processors or Texas Instruments AM3352 processor are recommended for their superior performance, advanced features, extensive connectivity options, and TIs commitment to low power applications.
